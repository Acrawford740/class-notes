Github Desktop can be on MAC and Windows but Currently doesn't work on linux.
Github can also be used in the terminal instead of the app.
Anyone from around the world can fork and change your code but you have to accept the change everytime they commmit it.

Terms:
    Commit/Summary - This is how you get ready to push your changes to the cloud.
    Push - Sends all your commited changes to the cloud.
    Pull - Takes all the changes from the cloud and edits your code to match the changes.
    Fetch - Will get any changes from the cloud but won't pull or push.
    Fork - Creating a copy of the program that you can send to the owner of the repository for any changes you make.
