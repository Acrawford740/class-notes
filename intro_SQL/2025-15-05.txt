Be careful when droping databases and tables they will not ask if you are sure so make sure you have backups and your code is right before running it.

Terms:
    CREATE TABLE - creates a table but you have to set the columns and types
    TRUNCATE - a delete that resets the uniqueness
    DROP TABLE - deletes the table but keeps uniqueness
    DROP DATABASE - fully deletes a database DOESN'T ask for verification
    CREATE DATABASE/SCHEMA - creates a blank database
    ALTER TABLE - lets you alter the columns inside of the table
    DROP COLUMN - deletes the table
    MODIFY/ALTER COLUMN - lets you change the datatype of columns
    ADD COLUMN - creates a new column
    RENAME COLUMN - rename an exisiting column
    cash - putting something in memory to make it faster to grab
    CONSTARINT - creates a new constraint
    DROP INDEX - drops a constraint
    Constraint - lets you limit what can be put in a column
        NOT NULL - the record cannot be empty
        UNIQUE - it can't match any other records in the column, it is put at the end
        PRIMARY KEY - combines NOT NULL and UNIQUE the main column of the table, has to be at the end
        FOREIGN KEY - prevents actions to destroy links between tables, has to be at the end and refrence where it is in the other table
        CHECK - it checks if the data matches the check
        DEFAULT - sets a default value for the column
        CREATE INDEX - makes it faster to search through data
