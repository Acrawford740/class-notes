Be careful when droping databases and tables they will not ask if you are sure so make sure you have backups and your code is right before running it.

Terms:
    CREATE TABLE - creates a table but you have to set the columns and types
    TRUNCATE - a delete that resets the uniqueness
    DROP TABLE - deletes the table but keeps uniqueness
    DROP DATABASE - fully deletes a database DOESN'T ask for verification
    CREATE DATABASE/SCHEMA - creates a blank database
